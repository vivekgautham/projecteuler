                You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

                1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
                Thirty days has September,
                April, June and November.
                All the rest have thirty-one,
                Saving February alone,
                Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
                And on leap years, twenty-nine.
                A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
                How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
